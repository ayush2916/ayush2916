I'm a Computer Science engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include HTML , CSS , Javascript and Old School C++ .  My interest in the Front End Web Development led me to launch a Free Covid 19 Website <a href="https://practical-mccarthy-f0d71b.netlify.app">CoviTracker</a>, a platform where you can easily scroll with a mouse or keypad to get all the basic Information about Covid 19 , Avail some Basic Services and Track down the number of covid cases with a Live Tracker.
